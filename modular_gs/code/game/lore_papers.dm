	OOC: Your goal here is to capture people to fatten up. Avoid intentionally killing and causing chaos on the station if you can at all help it. <br>\
	Before capturing someone, be sure to check their preferences and make sure that they are not already occupied. A discord message or LOOC never hurts if you aren't sure. OOC communication is very important. <br>\
	You have the power to send people back to the station, make sure that you talk with them before sending them back. Especially if they are someone that wasn't on the station in the first place, like a Den Victim. \
	<br>\
	It is heavily advised that you find a target before you teleport onto the station as some crew members are not good canidates.<br>\
	With the camera console you have access to the entire camera network of the station, use this to your advantage to formulate a plan. \
	<br><br>\
	Right before heading onto the station, make sure that you grab a science tool and sync it with the feeder console. \
	Syncing it will allow you to beam both yourself and captives back to the den. \
	To do this, mark the person you want to mark by touching them with the tool. Once someone is marked you can use the tool on them again to beam them up.<br>\
	Additionally, if you have someone to help you, they can beam up anyone that is marked, by using the camera console.\
	<br><br>\
	Credits can be gained by having someone you fattened up use the tracking scale. Keep in mind that credits can only be gained when someone surpasses their previous max weight.\
	Additionally, you are only able to get 900 credits from a person.\
	<br><br>\
	You are able to use the console and pad to send victims back to the station after you are done with them. Avoid sending them anywhere dangerous or obvious unless you want to risk the ire of GATO. "

				<h3>Drinks for Growing Guts</h3>

				Been a bartender for Gato quite a while now. In my time here, I've taken notice of how certain mixes produced...
				Certain effects, that the same mixtures don't produce elsewhere. I'm writing down my findings here.

				<ol>
				<li><b>Belly Bloats:</b> equal parts gibb floats and beer. Really bulks up a belly. Some folks got real bloated with air after drinking this one.</li>
				<li><b>Blobby Mary:</b> equal parts tomato juice, vodka and lipoifier. If you want to get back at some rich folks, this is your drink.</li>
				<li><b>Heavy Cafe:</b> equal parts latte, either cafe or soy, sugar and cream. One hell of a bomb to start a shift with.</li>
				<li><b>Fruits Tea:</b> equal parts berry juice, lemon juice and tea. Even teetotal folks aren't safe from growing. Some folks become... Real sloshy. Note: I once mixed it with blueberry juice from a vendor. Be ready to juice if you do too.</li>
				<li><b>Snakebite:</b> equal parts toxins, lime juice and lipoifier. Feels like a snake biting your throat when it goes down. Sure "paralyzes" like some real snake bites.</li>
				<li><b>Beltbuster Mead:</b> equal parts mead, ethanol, cream and lipoifier. Very alcoholic and immensely fattening. Clothes won't hold after this one.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				Remember, this stuff is quite something. Don't serve these to folks that don't want it.

				<h3>The Strange Chems of GATO-Controlled Sectors</h3>

				Peculiar reactions not found anywhere else taken within the sector of GATO's control, especially within the station of GS13.
				To ensure that the knowledge isn't lost to time, I've decided some of the simpler reactions here.

				<ol>
				<li><b>Lipoifier:</b> The opposite of Lipolicide. Seems to multiply fat cells in one's body. Equal parts corn oil, sugar and synthflesh.</li>
				<li><b>Fizulphite:</b> Seems to stir up a strange reaction in stomachs, making them all bubbly. 1u of nitrogen, 1u sugar and 3u of oxygen.</li>
				<li><b>Extilphite:</b> Very useful chem! Helps soothe stomach bloat and relieves fullness. 1u sugar, 2u hydrogen, 2u carbon.</li>
				<li><b>Flatulose:</b> This chemical is similar to Fizulphite, but results in uncontrolled release of rear gasses. 1u sugar, 1u of Bad Food, 1u of Cream.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				Remember to be responsible with those chems. They aren't lethal or toxic, but they can be undesired by locals.

					<li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
						<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">The Captain holds responsibility for a station&apos;s operations during a shift, while the responsibility for the individual departments and their members is given to the other members of Command, also referred to as Heads. These are the Head of Security for Security, Head of Personnel for Service, Chief Medical Officer for Medical, Chief Engineer for Engineering, the Quartermaster for Cargo and the Research Director for Science.</span></p>

					<li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
						<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Should no Captain be on duty during a shift but someone is required to fill in the position, an Acting Captain can be assigned from between the present members of Command. This position gives them the same authority as a Captain, but the position is relinquished as soon as someone is assigned to the position proper. Democratic vote can be used, if need be, to decide who should hold the position and to revoke it should the majority of Command deem one unfit for the role.</span></p>

				<ul>
					<li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
						<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Disruptive Behavior may contain many sorts of minor infractions, enforcement should be applied with reason. Taking a pen for a minute to write down something does not cause an actual disruption, neither does leaving a single O2 closet open or ignoring orders that would clearly cause harm to others or the station. Do not use this as an umbrella law to arrest or act against crew members who are doing no actual wrong, especially if the behavior is not being repeated or has caused no actual disruption.</span></p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p><br></p>
				<ul>
					<li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
						<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Dereliction of Duty implies that, through willful inaction, damage was inflicted on the station or its personnel. Simply not doing anything can be considered, AT WORST, Disruptive Behavior. A doctor hanging by the bar is not Dereliction nor Disruption- It is Dereliction if they decide to not do their job when a medical emergency is happening.</span></p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p><br></p>
				<ul>
					<li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
						<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">In case of &ldquo;skeleton crew&rdquo;, as in there are very few people present and many of the roles are not covered, apply Dire Need generously. If, for example, someone really needs a chemical from Chemistry to do something related to their job, give them a pass for sneaking in to get it when no Medical Staff is present. This is all to favor roleplay after all.</span></p>

                <h2>What is GATO? </h2>
				<p>
				GATO Industrial Concern is a corporation that operates in every sector known to all sapients. Agriculture, luxurious goods, R&D, pharmaceuticals- if it exists, we make it! Your current employment is upon a....: <p>
				GENERAL STATION
				<p>
				Lucky you! A General Station is one that does not specialize in any particular type of production, and profits off of whatever it can manage to export. You've heard us! So long as the crew can attain profitable goods and ship it off to Central Command, you're doing your job! Here at Gato, we understand how autonomy for stations can improve both the conditions of workers and stimulate both creativity and innovation. As a result, we have permitted you to have nearly free reign over your activities, far from bureaucracy and regulation. That's much better than Nanotrasen, right?
				<p>

				<h1><u>Chapter 2</u></h1>
				<h2>The origin of GATO</h2>
				<p>
				Gato's story begins around the beginning of the 22nd century. It was a truly hard time, indeed! Between the troublesome and expensive startup process of making a small business, and the crushing weight of bigger corporations, one would think that setting up a business was financial suicide. But our founder,
				<i>~~-`11@#\[ERROR\]</i>
				, thought otherwise! So, GatoMart was founded, and we were instantly known for our creativity. Cute designs and friendly service built us the profit and recognition we needed to expand! And expand we did, taking on more and more corporations under our wing until we became the way we are today. Now, you can find Gato products all across the galaxy, ranging from simple things like cheese slices to more complex heavy artillery platforms! Isn't it grand to participate in maintaining such an awesome corporation like ours?

                <h2>The current state of Gato</h2>

				Many people have begun to circulate bad rumors that Gato is beginning to decline. Dear employees, as honest, loving, and trustworthy employers, we must deny those claims! The Syndicate does not pose much of a threat, and we have continued to profit despite the odds! So do not fear, neither your wages nor your employment are currently at risk. We would never think of doing something that would cause such anguish to the members of our beloved company! Perhaps it is time to go onto a more pleasant topic... how the corporate hierarchy works! At the bottom, we have common workers, above that are your Department Heads, and above that is your Captain! And your Captain answers to our Central Command teams, who are subordinate to the Head of Central Command, who reports to the Branch Manager, who answers to the Executive Officers, who answer to the CEO(Chief Executive Officer!), who answers to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors equally listens to the input of our most trusted shareholders, and the Head of the Board!

However, you are welcome to plot and make escape attempts. Should you make an escape attempt, you are not permitted to randomly kill crew or security officers. Escaping prison simply to kill people is murderboning and will be treated as a rule violation, rather than a violation of SOP. When escaping, you will be pursued by security. Ending up in a scene with a crewmember mid-escape does not protect you from being captured and transported back to prison.</em><p>
		<p style= "text-align:left;font-family:Permanent Marker;font-size: 100%">1. You have been permanently imprisoned for crimes against GATO, the station, and/or her crew.<p>
		<p style= "text-align:center;font-family:Permanent Marker;font-size: 100%;margin: 0px 50px">a. If playing as a prisoner off the bat, it is encouraged to have a security note detailing what crime you were sentenced for.<p>
		<p style= "text-align:left;font-family:Permanent Marker;font-size: 100%">2. Your punishment for this crime will vary depending upon the severity, but can range from permanent imprisonment to exile or even death.<p>
		<p style= "text-align:left;font-family:Permanent Marker;font-size: 100%">3. You are permitted to make requests for accommodations, visitations, and even legal counsel permitting that a lawyer is available to represent you.<p>

		<p style= "text-align:left;font-family:Permanent Marker;font-size: 100%">5. Prisoners making escape attempts will be handled by officers in accordance to the threat they pose based on the severity of their initial crimes and violent actions toward officers in their escape attempt. As an example:<p>
		<p style= "text-align:center;font-family:Permanent Marker;font-size: 100%;margin: 0px  50px">a. A prisoner who escapes and slips out unnoticed without causing harm or stealing weapons will be pursued with non-lethal force.<p>
		<p style= "text-align:center;font-family:Permanent Marker;font-size: 100%;margin: 0px 50px">b. A prisoner who escapes and slips out unnoticed without causing harm, but who was imprisoned for murder, will still be pursued with lethal force.<p>

Drag around all the satellites in front of solar panel arrays, preferably in direction open to space (the best spot is near the solar tracker and outside of the grilles), as that is where the space sand will come from. It's advised to set down just 1 satellite for each solar array. Once you set the satellite down, you can activate it by flicking on the switch. The crate also provides you with an OPTIONAL computer board to keep track of your defence satellites. Voila!</p>"
